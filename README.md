# Image-Captions-with-BLIP
This repo uses the BLIP model trained by Salesforce to generate captions for images. It takes an input image, processes it, and outputs a caption generated by the model. It also  captions for images on a website.

To add captions to your selected image, image_cap.py provides a simple Gradio interface developed with Gradio. 
To caption images from a website, you need to manually specify the website path in the script.
